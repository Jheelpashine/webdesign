<h3>Black Bat flower</h3>
<img class="img" src="https://bouqs .com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/black-bat-flower. jpg"></img>
<p>It's uncommon to find a black flower. It's extraordinarily rare to come across a dark flower
as strange looking as the black bat flower. </p></div>

<h3>Silk Tree</h3>
<img class="img" src="https ://bouqs. com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/silk-tree. jpg"></img>
<p>Also known as mimosa trees, these small trees produce silky flowers that resemble little pom-poms.
If that's not enough of a reason to love them, they have a uniquely sweet fragrance. </p></div>

<h3>Surprise Lily</h3>

<p>While many plants produce leaves then flower shortly after, surprise lilies do things a bit differently.
After you place bulbs in the ground, the plants will send up leaves that later die back. < /p></div>

<h3>Sea Holly</h3>

<p>This genus of plants has spiky blue flowers that look a bit like thistles. The spiky cones are surrounded
by serrated bracts, giving the flowers a frightening yet alluring appearance. </p></div>
